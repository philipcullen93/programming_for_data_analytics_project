# Project: Irish Wind Speed and Energy Potential Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyses historical Irish weather data from Met Éireann to investigate wind speed patterns and estimate the relative wind energy generation potential at selected weather stations across Ireland. The analysis is carried out using a Jupyter Notebook and focuses on understanding how wind characteristics vary spatially and temporally, with particular relevance to wind farm suitability and green energy generation.

The project demonstrates data acquisition, cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualisation, and applied interpretation.

## Objectives

1. Load and clean historical weather data from Met Éireann

2.  Explore wind speed distributions across multiple Irish weather stations

3. Analyse daily and long-term wind speed trends

4. Estimate relative wind energy generation using a simplified physical model

5. Compare stations to assess suitability for wind energy generation

## Data Source

Provider: Met Éireann – The Irish Meteorological Service

Dataset: Historical Weather Observations (CSV files)

Stations Used:

- Malin Head

- Valentia Observatory

- Dublin Airport

- Mullingar

The raw data files were downloaded manually from the Met Éireann website and stored locally in the data/ directory.
